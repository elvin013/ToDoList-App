# ToDoList-App

ToDOList App is a web application where users can create tasks to perform, these tasks can be edited, deleted, filtered if completed or not, among other things.

We can create an account in the application to log in or also log in with a temporary user that is valid for 30 minutes, although the user can keep said user if they choose.

The app also has options to change the personal information and login credentials of temporary and permanent users and has a log that saves all logins and registrations made in the app.
